# Mars Rover Mission

### 10 x 10 UI Grid

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface
of the planet. We create a software that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions
that are understood by the rover.

We can send instructions by keyboard one by one or sending a series of it with an input.

The rover can move:

- Forward: **F** in input or **W** on keyboard
- Left: **L** in input or **A** on keyboard
- Right: **R** in input or **D** on keyboard
